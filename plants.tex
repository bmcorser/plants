\chapter{Nature Eruption}

It is only in the quiet of panels, when horror vacui is quietly receded from,
that movement can begin to come from nature. A thing that should not shudder
begins to exhibit the first tremors of life. The sensation of bubbling beneath
the feet, a fibrous crunching, something like the tiny sounds at the bottom of
the lungs on a deep breath.  There is a kind of panting. An eruption is coming.

In a regimented frame, there is an attempt to cast authority and the appearance
of order. This is a setting without exclamation. This is not a place where
anything slides luxuriously from upright to reclining, but a desperate calmness
sites itself in the air, an hyperactive stillness. It is not possible to put
this frame anywhere (to give it a context), instead an observer must impose
themselves as a figure for things to become real. There is no coquettishness or
promise, instead there is an air of hastily of concieved urgency, like a dull
background panic or pale anxiety. The subtly implied threat of a Lacanian
reality is thinly contained here, as thinly as it is possible to contain
something. It may be impressive that this containment is so complete.

This should be the conception of a very sublime perspective, to solve an issue
outside of flesh and to have solved it with a light touch. It is difficult to
see the weight that maintains the rigidity holding things up. The weight is
hidden by design, stacked above head-height, put inside walls, mirrored away.

There is a physical tension around us, like being inside a cat's cradle. This
is not a situation that begs exploration, but we explore anyway. Free movement
in this space makes the space itself feel tenuous. It feels as if everything
could wink out of existance if the improper floor tile were stepped on.
\emph{The three of us tread carefully.} We emulate the stasis through which we
find ourselves moving.

Nothing suggests relief will come, the unbroken hush hums perpetuity and
likewise waves of silence ripple and echo from a cavernous above. The light
doesn't obviously come from anywhere, it seems to be somehow within the beams
and panes and floors and walls. The edges of things look drawn on, the
definition between things to form recognisable objects is only made as an
amicable gesture.

But some good change is on its way, the very source of levity itself will soon
be upon us in a shock of lush green. With one glance, the mind delves into the
jungles of the mind, the immediate possibility of an inhabitance entirely
different in character brusquely presents itself. We exclaim \emph{``This is
the opposite!''} as creepers and ferns erupt from below head height, marking an
acute end to mundane sterility. Beginning at waist height, spilling
voluptuously down to almost touch the floor and sprouting upwards to reach just
below the neckline, fronds elegantly bowing to the tip.

We find a formality here that appears naturally, without method or intent,
sensual and striking. Flowing arcs effortlessly mixed with staccato points.
Misplaced ribbing and frantic groupings of tiny fluted spouts. And here too
the pure violence and natural struggle that constitute life.

\chapter{Plinth'd Nature}

From a pedestal such as this one there is nothing further to be strived for but
full commune with the heavens. An exemplar is chosen, lightweight channelling
infrastructure is put in place, the thing is given an ``open top'', its
delicate spread of antennae are placed out of arm's reach, requisite lucky
charms are added.

The base has wholly settled with the ground it sits on, is happy to be
possessed. It is an earthly protuberance that is relatively immovable when cast
against the object it hosts at the point where it gets as far as it goes.  it
can surely support this static display.

that should at any moment leap into brief, hideous, frenetic action as the raw
power of the universe carves a bolt across eons, through timeless permanence
and permanence, just to be in touch with an object that will be there \emph{one
time only}.  This thing is a one-shot fabrication designed to take a massive,
single, momentary input.  There is nothing to see here close up, so we stand
back. Not one amongst us wants to have his eyebrows singed by pthe power of the
infinite.

In this composition the perfect balance is struck in a sweep of asymmetry. An
image sails ahead unhanded and without guidance, forging a path of light and
leaving a spreading wake of shadows behind it.

We can see the typical artifacts of industrial construction where the visual
evidence that is the side-effect of this or that process is not considered a
stain, but something that is simply there because of the neccesity the pleas
for attendance from smaller details have been silenced by the needs of larger
work that is taking place.

Standing in front of this arrangement, the observer is thrown into a terrible
motion of their own. The coloured forms of the world shutter past at pace,
a cooling jet of histories and new ideas shatter over the forehead and spill
away in dual rivers down the shoulders. This is motion without destination, as
with illynx.
