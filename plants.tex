\chapter{Nature Eruption}

It is only in the quiet of panels, when horror vacui is quietly receded from,
that movement can begin to come from nature. A thing that should not shudder
begins to exhibit the first tremors of life. The sensation of bubbling beneath
the feet, a fibrous crunching, something like the tiny sounds at the bottom of
the lungs on a deep breath. There is a kind of panting. An eruption is coming.

In a regimented frame, there is an attempt to cast authority and the appearance
of order. This is a setting without exclamation. This is not a place where
anything slides luxuriously from upright to reclining, but a desperate calmness
sites itself in the air, an hyperactive stillness. It is not possible to put
this frame anywhere (to give it a context), instead an observer must attempt to
impose themselves as a figure for things to become real. Unfortunately, this
impetus is anticipated in the observer and a patishe of their figure is ``pre''
placed in the scene, already there, waiting for them.

There is no coquettishness or promise, instead there is an air of hastily
concieved urgency, like a dull background panic or pale anxiety. The subtly
implied threat of a Lacanian reality is veiled with an extreme economy. As
lightly as is is possible to contain something, that is how things are
contained here. It may be impressive, then, that this containment is so
complete.

This should be the conception of a very sublime perspective, to solve an issue
outside of flesh and to have solved it with a light touch. It is difficult to
see the weight that maintains the rigidity holding things up. The weight is
hidden by design, stacked above head-height, put inside walls, mirrored away.

There is a physical tension around us, like being inside a cat's cradle. This
is not a situation that begs exploration, but we explore anyway. Free movement
in this space makes the space itself feel tenuous. It feels as if everything
could wink out of existance if the improper floor tile were stepped on.
\emph{The three of us tread carefully.} We emulate the stasis through which we
find ourselves moving.

Nothing suggests relief will come, the unbroken hush hums perpetuity and
likewise waves of silence ripple and echo from a cavernous above. The light
doesn't obviously come from anywhere, it seems to be somehow within the beams
and panes and floors and walls. The edges of things look drawn on, the
definition between things to form recognisable objects is only made as an
amicable gesture.

But some good change is on its way, the very source of levity itself will soon
be upon us in a shock of lush green. With one glance, the mind delves into the
jungles of the mind, the immediate possibility of an inhabitance entirely
different in character brusquely presents itself. We exclaim \emph{``This is
the opposite!''} as creepers and ferns erupt from below head height, marking an
acute end to mundane sterility. Beginning at waist height, spilling
voluptuously down to almost touch the floor and sprouting upwards to reach just
below the neckline, fronds elegantly bowing to the tip.

We find a formality here that appears naturally, without method or intent,
sensual and striking. Flowing arcs effortlessly mixed with staccato points.
Misplaced ribbing and frantic groupings of tiny fluted spouts. And here too
the pure violence and natural struggle that constitute life.

From a pedestal such as this one there is nothing further to be strived for but
full commune with the heavens. A small exemplar is chosen, lightweight
channelling infrastructure is put in place, the thing is given an ``open top'',
its delicate spread of antennae are placed well out of arm's reach, requisite
lucky charms are added.

The base has wholly settled with the ground it sits on, happy to be possessed
in this way. So this earthly protuberance that is relatively immovable plays
host to a splindly collection placed at the point where it gets as far as it
goes. From the simple guarantee of some weight something more contingent
emerges.

This is a thing that should at any moment leap into brief, hideous, frenetic
action as the raw power of the universe carves a bolt across eons, through
timeless permanence and permanence, just to be in touch with an object that
will be there \emph{one time only}.  This thing is a one-shot fabrication
designed to take a massive, single, momentary input. There is nothing to see
here close up, so we stand back. Not one amongst us wants to have his eyebrows
singed by the power of the infinite.

In this composition the perfect balance is struck in a sweep of asymmetry. An
image sails ahead unhanded and without guidance, forging a path of light and
leaving a spreading wake of shadows behind it.

Standing in front of this arrangement, this image of duality, the observer is
thrown into a terrible and relentless motion of their own. The coloured forms
of the world shutter past at pace, a cooling jet of histories and or of new
ideas shatter over the forehead and spill away in dual rivers down the
shoulders. This is motion without destination, as with illynx.

We see the expected, more human-scaled, more understandable artifacts of an
industrial construction; the visual clues that the thing as a whole did not
simply spring into existence, but rather was the result of some repeated,
tangental activity. This evidence appears as the side-effect of a serious
process, not as a direct mark. It arrives due to the neccesity of silencing the
pleas for attendance from smaller details in favour of the needs of larger work
that is taking place.

We have an acute angle into another world, lined with bait. The intention is to
funnel enriching material from another place to here. A crooked trick is set up
to goad the creeping and splintered advances from a different existence to this
relatively impoverished one.

We don't remember what happened to us, just beginning to chase a new thought as
finance and oil exploded around us (in our midst). For a period nothing aged,
everything was \emph{as it was} and would always be. Our shared past, the
colloquial history of apes and animals was forgotten and cast aside in exchange
for this moment of shining clarity cast in shiny plastic.

At that time our ``out-of-placeness'' became something commodifiable, the
hideous beast lurking within was invited (with wide open arms and a wild grin)
to present itself pubicly in lavish media form, fully out in the world. In this
gesture the animal in man became a caricature of itself, pathetically
soliciting for encouragement (greeting and hollering) and accepting any given.

Even money as we knew it ceased to have proper meaning, instead finance became
a kind of assumed government. We would never again have need to fish as we used
to, there would be pure oppotunity for every man to \emph{have} the things he
desired; living in this bizarre new democracy of home furnishings and ergonomic
kitchen utensils.

Things became red and white and blue without anyone intending them to be. Where
before wealth had distinct and well-defined characteristics, now a new formal
appearance began to develop, eschewing decoration and detail for ergonomics and
ultilitarian elegance. The judgements that for years could be made by studying
the appearance of things suddenly ceased to valid
